# Interface Types proposal

This repository contains the Interface Types proposal, which is the
second proposal of the [Component Model], building on [Module Linking].

Links:
* the general [explainer](design/proposals/interface-types/Explainer.md) for this proposal
* the proposed [binary format](TODO)
* a sketch of the [canonical ABI](TODO)
* a vague sketch of what Post-MVP [generalized adapter functions](TODO) could look like

All Component Model work is done as part of the [W3C WebAssembly Community Group].
To contribute to any of these repositories, see the Community Group's
